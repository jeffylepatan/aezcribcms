5. Credits automatically added to user account

### Manual Credit Addition
```php
// Add 100 AezCoins to user ID 5
$credit_service = \Drupal::service('aezcrib_commerce.credit_service');
$credit_service->addCredits(5, 100);
```

## Integration with Frontend

The React dashboard can call these endpoints:

```javascript
// Get user credits
const response = await fetch('/api/aezcrib/credits');
const data = await response.json();

// Purchase worksheet
const purchase = await fetch('/api/aezcrib/purchase/worksheet/123', {
  method: 'POST'
});

// Get recommendations
const recs = await fetch('/api/aezcrib/recommendations');
```

## Database Schema

The module creates:
- User field: `field_credits` (Integer)
- Content types: `credit_transaction`, `purchase_transaction`
- All associated field storage and configurations

## Logging

All transactions are logged to the 'aezcrib_commerce' log channel for audit purposes.

## Security Features

- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own data
- File downloads verified against ownership
- SQL injection protection via Entity API
- CSRF protection on all POST requests

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed - the module works out of the box after installation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Credits not adding**: Check transaction status is 'completed'
2. **Download not working**: Verify PDF file exists and user owns worksheet
3. **Recommendations empty**: User needs purchase history for personalization

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check user credits
drush eval "echo aezcrib_commerce_get_user_credits(1);"

# Check if user owns worksheet
drush eval "echo aezcrib_commerce_user_owns_worksheet(1, 123) ? 'Yes' : 'No';"
```
